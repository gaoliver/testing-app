# Testing (T/J)est

This is just an APP for studying Jest Testing on React Native.

### How to run it

If you are curious about it, just clone this repo on your machine, then - inside the project folder - open the terminal and run:

```Shell
yarn && yarn test
```

And that's it.

If you also want to run the app to see it on Expo, run:

```Shell
yarn start
```
